<p align="center"><b>Player is a simple cross-platform video player library written in Swift.</b>
<br>
<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Warning</b>: version 0.9 has breaking API changes. ‚ö†Ô∏è</p>

### Looking for...
- An obj-c video player? Check out [PBJVideoPlayer (obj-c)](https://github.com/piemonte/PBJVideoPlayer).
- A Swift camera library? Check out [Next Level](https://github.com/NextLevel/NextLevel).

### Features
- [x] plays local media or streams remote media over HTTP
- [x] customizable UI and user interaction
- [x] optional system-supplied playback controls
- [x] no size restrictions
- [x] orientation change support
- [x] simple API
- [x] AirPlay & PIP support (see [`AVPlayerController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avplayerviewcontroller) documentation)

### I'm a ~~Rapper~~ Wrapper
- uses [`AVPlayerViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avplayerviewcontroller) on iOS/tvOS platforms for system-supplied playback controls (See `usesSystemPlaybackControls`). Otherwise, an [`AVPlayerLayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlayer).
- uses [`AVPlayerView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avplayerview) on the macOS platform.

## Installation
`Player` is available for installation using CocoaPods or Carthage.  Alternatively, you can simply copy the `Player.swift` file into your Xcode project.

### Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

```ruby
pod "Player"
```

Need Swift 3? Use release `0.7.0`. **Note**: macOS and system-supplied playback controls not supported.

```ruby
pod "Player", "~> 0.7.0"
```

### Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

```ruby
github "piemonte/Player"
```

## Quick Start

The sample projects provide an example of how to integrate `Player`, otherwise you can follow these steps.

Create and add the `Player` to your view controller.

```swift
let player = Player()
// Optional
player.playerDelegate = self
// Optional
player.playbackDelegate = self
player.view.frame = view.bounds
player.add(to: self)
```

Provide the file path to the resource you would like to play locally or stream. Ensure you're including the file extension.

```swift
player.url = URL(string: "https://www.apple.com/105/media/us/iphone-x/2017/01df5b43-28e4-4848-bf20-490c34a926a7/films/meet-iphone-x/iphone-x-meet-iphone-tpl-cc-us-20171129_1280x720h.mp4")
```

play/pause/chill üèñÔ∏è

```swift
player.playFromBeginning()
player.pause()
```

Adjust the fill mode for the video, if needed. Note: On iOS, this property is ignored if using system-supplied playback controls.

```swift
player.fillMode = .resizeAspectFit
```

The fill mode can be set to the following values:

`.resizeAspectFit` (default)

![.resizeAspectFit](https://github.com/chriszielinski/Player/raw/master/readme-assets/aspectFit.png)

`.resizeAspectFill`

![.resizeAspectFill](https://github.com/chriszielinski/Player/raw/master/readme-assets/aspectFill.png)

`.resizeStretch` (aka please don't. I mean look at that poor thing)

![.resizeStretch](https://github.com/chriszielinski/Player/raw/master/readme-assets/stretch.png)

Display video playback progress, if desired. Note, all delegate methods are optional.

```swift
extension ViewController: PlayerPlaybackDelegate {
    public func playerPlaybackWillStartFromBeginning(player: Player) {}
    
    public func playerPlaybackDidEnd(player: Player) {}
    
    public func playerCurrentTimeDidChange(player: Player) {
        let currentProgress = Float(player.currentTime / player.maximumDuration)
        progressView.setProgress(currentProgress, animated: true)
    }
    
    public func playerPlaybackWillLoop(player: Player) {
        progressView.setProgress(0.0, animated: false)
    }
}
```

## iOS & tvOS
On iOS/tvOS platforms, the player displays system-supplied playback controls by default. 

![iOS system-supplied controls](https://github.com/chriszielinski/Player/raw/master/readme-assets/ios-controls.png)

![tvOS system-supplied controls](https://github.com/chriszielinski/Player/raw/master/readme-assets/tvos-controls.png)

These are optional and can be disabled as follows:

```swift
...
// Need to set before calling `add(to:)`
player.usesSystemPlaybackControls = false
player.add(to: self)
```

## macOS
On the macOS platform, the player can display media controls as well. 

```swift
player.controlsStyle = .floating
```

The controls' style can be set to the following:

`.none`

`.inline` (default)

![Player](https://github.com/chriszielinski/Player/raw/master/readme-assets/inline.png)

`.minimal`

![Player](https://github.com/chriszielinski/Player/raw/master/readme-assets/minimal.png)

`.floating`
